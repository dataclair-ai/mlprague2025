Instead, it focuses on classifying *general-purpose AI models* (GPAI) with *systemic risk*. The reach to thousands of business users is **one factor** that contributes to the assessment of whether a GPAI model poses systemic risk, but it's not the only one, and it's not a definitive threshold.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n*   **Systemic Risk:**  Under the AI Act, GPAI models are classified as having systemic risk if they pose a significant risk to security, health, fundamental rights, society, democracy or the rule of law. This is a high bar, suggesting broad and potentially destabilizing impact.\n\n*   **Reach (and capabilities) as indicators:**  A large number of business users amplifies the *potential* impact of a GPAI model. If a model is used extensively by many businesses in the EU, any vulnerabilities, biases, or failures in the model could have widespread consequences.  This *reach* is considered *in conjunction with* the model's *capabilities* and the sectors using it. A model with limited capabilities, even with many users, might not be classified as systemic risk.\n\n*   **Specific criteria for GPAI with systemic risk** The AI Act (specifically Article 52a) requires the European Commission to develop criteria for determining systemic risk for GPAI models.  These criteria *will* likely include factors related to the model's size, complexity, capabilities (including tasks it can perform), *number of business users*, autonomy, and the extent of its use.\n\n*   **Other Factors:** Besides the number of users, other considerations include:\n    *   The *criticality* of the sectors using the model (e.g., healthcare, finance).\n    *   The model's ability to generate outputs that could be misused (e.g., deepfakes, disinformation).\n    *   The potential for the model to be used in ways that violate fundamental rights.\n    *   The model's computational resources required to train and run it.\n    *   Number of parameters (as a proxy for model complexity and capabilities).\n\n**In summary:** A large reach to thousands of business users in the EU increases the *likelihood* that a GPAI model will be considered to have systemic risk, especially if coupled with significant capabilities, use in critical sectors, or potential for misuse. However, it is not a guaranteed trigger. The final classification depends on a comprehensive assessment based on criteria established by the European Commission. The EU AI Office will also play a key role in this assessment.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iZ50lNuWz6AW"},"source":["Alright, this answer sounds pretty good.
