While the full effect of those prohibitions follows with the establishment of the governance and enforcement of this Regulation, anticipating the application of the prohibitions is important to take account of unacceptable risks and to have an effect on other procedures, such as in civil law. Moreover, the infrastructure related to the governance and the conformity assessment system should be operational before 2\\u00a0August 2026, therefore the provisions on notified bodies and governance structure should apply from 2\\u00a0August 2025. Given the rapid pace of technological advancements and adoption of general-purpose AI models, obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models should apply from 2\\u00a0August 2025. Codes of practice should be ready by 2\\u00a0May 2025 in view of enabling providers to demonstrate compliance on time. The AI Office should ensure that classification rules and procedures are up to date in light of technological developments. In addition, Member States should lay down and notify to the Commission the rules on penalties, including administrative fines, and ensure that they are properly and effectively implemented by the date of application of this Regulation.

It is therefore necessary to exclude from its scope AI systems and models specifically developed and put into service for the sole purpose of scientific research and development. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that this Regulation does not otherwise affect scientific research and development activity on AI systems or models prior to being placed on the market or put into service. As regards product-oriented research, testing and development activity regarding AI systems or models, the provisions of this Regulation should also not apply prior to those systems and models being put into service or placed on the market. That exclusion is without prejudice to the obligation to comply with this Regulation where an AI system falling into the scope of this Regulation is placed on the market or put into service as a\\u00a0result of such research and development activity and to the application of provisions on AI regulatory sandboxes and testing in real world conditions. Furthermore, without prejudice to the exclusion of AI systems specifically developed and put into service for the sole purpose of scientific research and development, any other AI system that may be used for the conduct of any research and development activity should remain subject to the provisions of this Regulation. In any event, any research and development activity should be carried out in accordance with recognised ethical and professional standards for scientific research and should be conducted in accordance with applicable Union law.\",\n          \"passage: Preamble\\n\\n(73)High-risk AI systems should be designed and developed in such a\\u00a0way that natural persons can oversee their functioning, ensure that they are used as intended and that their impacts are addressed over the system\\u2019s lifecycle. To that end, appropriate human oversight measures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placing on the market or putting into service. In particular, where appropriate, such measures should guarantee that the system is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be overridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the natural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary competence, training and authority to carry out that role. It is also essential, as appropriate, to ensure that high-risk AI systems include mechanisms to guide and inform a\\u00a0natural person to whom human oversight has been assigned to make informed decisions if, when and how to intervene in order to avoid negative consequences or risks, or stop the system if it does not perform as intended. Considering the significant consequences for persons in the case of an incorrect match by certain biometric identification systems, it is appropriate to provide for an enhanced human oversight requirement for those systems so that no action or decision may be taken by the deployer on the basis of the identification resulting from the system unless this has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons. Those persons could be from one or more entities and include the person operating or using the system. This requirement should not pose unnecessary burden or delays and it could be sufficient that the separate verifications by the different persons are automatically recorded in the logs generated by the system. Given the specificities of the areas of law enforcement, migration, border control and asylum, this requirement should not apply where Union or national law considers the application of that requirement to be disproportionate.\",\n          \"passage: Chapter III - HIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS\\n\\nSection 2 - Requirements for high-risk AI systems\\n\\nArticle 9 - Risk management system\\n\\n2.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0The risk management system shall be understood as a\\u00a0continuous iterative process planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a\\u00a0high-risk AI system, requiring regular systematic review and updating.

We learned how to **mine positives and negatives** using LLMs and cross-encoders to create high-quality training data\n","4. Finally, we **fine-tuned embedding models** using different training strategies and demonstrated significant performance improvements on our EU AI Act corpus\n","\n","These techniques provide a practical framework for improving domain-specific embedding models with relatively modest computational resources, even when labeled data is scarce."],"metadata":{"id":"anaz-noZ2cGd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**What to try next:**\n","> Interested in fine-tuning rerankers?
