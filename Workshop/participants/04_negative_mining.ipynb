We used techniques like grounding, personas, few-shot examples, and quality filtering to create realistic questions paired with the specific passage they were generated from.\n","\n","However, simply having a query and its source passage isn't enough to effectively fine-tune a powerful embedding model. We need a structured dataset that clearly tells the model:\n","1.  Which passages are highly relevant (positive examples) for a given query.\n","2.  Which passages are irrelevant or only semantically related (negative examples) to the query.\n","\n","This notebook bridges the gap between generating synthetic data and preparing it for fine-tuning. We'll dive into the **positive and negative documents mining**. Our goal is to transform the query-passage pairs generated previously into a robust training dataset containing `(query, positive_passage, negative_passages)` triplets.\n","\n","\\\n","\n","### Why Mine Positives and Negatives?\n","\n","Embedding models learn to map text to dense vector spaces where semantic similarity corresponds to proximity. To train them effectively, especially for information retrieval tasks, we need to explicitly teach them:\n","* Pull the vector representation of a query *closer* to the vector of its relevant passage(s).\n","* Push the vector representation of a query *away* from the vectors of irrelevant passages.\n","\n","A key challenge is that the original passage used to generate a query isn't always the *single best* answer within the entire corpus. Furthermore, simply using random irrelevant passages as negatives isn't optimal. The model learns more effectively when challenged with hard negatives: passages that are semantically similar to the query (e.g., using similar keywords) but don't actually answer it.\n","\n","\\\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Setup\n","\n","> ***Important:*** *If you want to evaluate or train the models in this notebook, make sure to have a GPU runtime enabled.

Bi-encoders create embeddings for the query and passages independently. This allows for very efficient searching over large corpora to find an initial set of candidate passages (e.g., the top 100 most similar). While fast, bi-encoders might not always capture the nuances of relevance perfectly.\n","\n","**Step 2: Reranking (LLM / Cross-Encoder)**\n","Next, we take the top candidates from the bi-encoder and re-evaluate them using more powerful but computationally intensive rerankers. Unlike bi-encoders, rerankers (like LLMs configured for ranking or specialized cross-encoders) process the query and each candidate passage together. This allows for a deeper understanding of their relationship and produces a more accurate relevance score.\n","\n","**Step 3: Positive and Negative Selection**\n","Finally, we use the refined order from the reranker(s) to:\n","* Select the top-ranked passage as our positive example.\n","* Select passages from further down the ranked list (e.g., ranks 10-20) as our hard negative examples.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1FeiCAUtX8N5LQkwXsVIckeNTSVmJkvbC\" alt=\"Evaluation metrics\" width=\"700\">\n","\n","Let's start with the initial retrieval.\n","\n","\n","# Step 1: Retrieve top-k documents for each synthetic query\n","\n","After generating synthetic queries in the previous notebooks, we need to search the top-k documents for each query using an existing embedding model.

It assigns a score to each document based on its rank in each list, giving higher scores to documents ranked consistently high across different systems. The score for a document `d` is calculated by summing `1 / (k + rank(d))` across all lists, where `rank(d)` is the document's position (starting from 0 or 1) and `k` is a constant (often 60) used to reduce the impact of high ranks dominating the score.\n","\n","By applying RRF, we can leverage the insights from both our LLM and cross-encoder rerankers to get a final, fused ranking of documents for each query.\n","\n","<details>\n","    <summary>Click here to view the formula</summary>\n","\n","$$\\text{RRF}(d) = \\sum_{r \\in R} \\frac{1}{k + r(d)}$$\n","\n","Where:\n","- $\\text{RRF}(d)$ = fusion score for document $d$\n","- $R$ = set of ranking systems being combined\n","- $r(d)$ = rank position of document $d$ in ranking $r$ (starting from 0)\n","- $k$ = constant (typically 60) that prevents division by zero and smooth the impact of high rankings\n","\n","\n","The constant $k$ prevents individual rankings from dominating and smooths the impact of top positions.</details>"],"metadata":{"id":"qXNaQjMoSLRE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def reciprocal_rank_fusion(df, k=20):\n","    fused_docs = []\n","\n","    for idx, row in df.iterrows():\n","        doc_scores = {}\n","        ce_ranking = row['reranked_docs_ce']\n","        llm_ranking = row['reranked_docs_llm']\n","\n","        for rank, doc_id in enumerate(ce_ranking):\n","            doc_scores[doc_id] = doc_scores.get(doc_id, 0) + 1.0 / (k + rank + 1)\n","\n","        for rank, doc_id in enumerate(llm_ranking):\n","            doc_scores[doc_id] = doc_scores.get(doc_id, 0) + 1.0 / (k + rank + 1)\n","\n","        sorted_docs = sorted(doc_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n","        fused_ranking = [doc_id for doc_id, score in sorted_docs]\n","        fused_docs.append(fused_ranking)\n","\n","    return fused_docs\n","\n","query_df['fused_docs'] = reciprocal_rank_fusion(query_df)\n","query_df.head(3)"],"metadata":{"id":"3Rw9RjY_N9Eo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745782920708,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":36,"user":{"displayName":"Ondra Čermák","userId":"10798119642940393606"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":300},"outputId":"a14a83a6-507f-4952-c1bf-072599934a49"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               query  psg_id  \\\n","0  How does the EU's AI Act ensure patient safety...       0   \n","1  In a scenario where a new AI system is develop...       0   \n","2  How does the EU's AI Act balance promoting inn...       1   \n","\n","                                         query_embed  \\\n","0  [-0.02386, -0.01636, -0.0348, 0.00841, 0.00685...   \n","1  [-0.002611, -0.00413, -0.03558, 0.02689, -0.00...   \n","2  [-0.02356, 0.00699, -0.02644, 0.00718, -0.0321...   \n","\n","                                         top_indices  \\\n","0  [2, 74, 145, 52, 0, 7, 192, 425, 6, 86, 55, 42...   \n","1  [0, 2, 23, 7, 506, 22, 175, 52, 81, 74, 591, 1...   \n","2  [7, 2, 0, 1, 5, 10, 8, 52, 503, 54, 6, 74, 9, ...   \n","\n","                                          top_scores  source_doc_rank  \\\n","0  [0.6494140625, 0.64599609375, 0.64306640625, 0...                4   \n","1  [0.72998046875, 0.7177734375, 0.7080078125, 0....                0   \n","2  [0.69287109375, 0.658203125, 0.65478515625, 0....                3   \n","\n","                                   reranked_docs_llm  \\\n","0  [52, 26, 86, 6, 0, 74, 10, 2, 192, 5, 8, 425, ...   \n","1  [0, 2, 7, 52, 9, 74, 229, 23, 22, 10, 81, 506,...   \n","2  [7, 0, 200, 1, 2, 195, 5, 52, 6, 8, 54, 10, 50...   \n","\n","                                    reranked_docs_ce  \\\n","0  [74, 7, 0, 6, 2, 80, 52, 55, 157, 8, 5, 145, 1...   \n","1  [0, 2, 7, 22, 52, 10, 74, 26, 633, 9, 591, 23,...   \n","2  [7, 200, 0, 195, 1, 54, 2, 10, 503, 504, 9, 81...   \n","\n","                                          fused_docs  \n","0  [74, 52, 0, 6, 2, 86, 80, 8, 5, 192, 55, 425, ...  \n","1  [0, 2, 7, 52, 22, 74, 9, 10, 23, 229, 633, 81,...  \n","2  [7, 200, 0, 1, 195, 2, 54, 10, 5, 503, 8, 6, 5...

However, they were ultimately judged as not the best answer by our reranking process.\n","- These documents serve as good choice for hard negatives because they force the model to learn the finer distinctions required to identify the truly correct answer among semantically similar options.\n","\n","We will now implement this by selecting documents from specific indices in our `fused_docs` list. The `negative_indices` parameter defines which ranks to pick (e.g., `range(10, 20, 2)` would select the documents at ranks 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 or you can provide a list, such as `[10, 15, 20]`).

carefully selecting hard negative documents for more effective training.\n","\n","### Next Steps:\n","\n","In the upcoming notebook `05_finetuning.ipynb`, we will perform the actual model training. We plan to:\n","\n","1.  Fine-tune a pre-trained embedding model using the initial, **uncurated** query-document pairs generated earlier (before the refinement steps in this notebook).\n","2.  Separately fine-tune the same pre-trained model using the **curated** dataset we just created (with refined positives and hard negatives).\n","3.
