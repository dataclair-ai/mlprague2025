Here's a breakdown of how reach contributes to that assessment:\n","\n","**1. Interconnectedness and Interdependence:**\n","\n","*   **Business Operations:**  When a GPAI model is used across a large number of businesses, it becomes deeply interwoven into their operations. This creates dependencies where a failure or vulnerability in the AI system can have cascading effects, disrupting or impairing multiple organizations simultaneously. Think of it as a keystone species in an ecosystem; its removal (or failure) leads to collapse.\n","*   **Data Flows:** GPAI models often handle large volumes of data from diverse sources. A systemic risk arises when the AI's decisions, biases, or vulnerabilities affect the integrity, accuracy, or security of this data across a broad range of businesses.  A problem in the GPAI could propagate incorrect or harmful information quickly.\n","*   **Decision-Making:** If a GPAI model is used for critical business decisions (e.g., loan approvals, pricing, hiring), its influence spreads quickly. Widespread reliance on a single biased or flawed model can lead to discriminatory outcomes or suboptimal resource allocation across the entire economy, creating a systemic effect.\n","\n","**2. Concentration of Risk:**\n","\n","*   **Single Point of Failure:** A widely used GPAI concentrates risk in a single system. If the AI provider experiences a security breach, technical failure, or even undergoes a policy change, thousands of EU businesses are directly affected. This makes the overall system (the EU economy) far more vulnerable than if the same functionality was distributed among various, independent systems.\n","*   **Market Dominance:**  A GPAI model with a large user base may indicate the provider holds significant market power. This dominant position amplifies the potential for systemic risk, as there might be limited alternatives for businesses that depend on the AI.  The AI provider's actions, good or bad, have a much larger impact.\n","\n","**3. Magnitude of Impact:**\n","\n","*   **Economic Disruption:** A widespread failure or malfunction of a GPAI model could lead to significant economic losses across multiple sectors in the EU. The more businesses that rely on the AI, the greater the potential for widespread economic disruption.\n","*   **Social Impact:** Biases or inaccuracies in a widely used GPAI model can amplify existing inequalities and create new social problems. For example, biased hiring algorithms could perpetuate discrimination, affecting thousands of individuals and communities.\n","*   **Systemic Instability:** A major incident involving a widely used GPAI model could undermine public trust in AI, damage the reputation of EU businesses, and even destabilize the broader financial or social systems.\n","\n","**4.  EU AI Act & Systemic Risk Criteria:**\n","\n","The EU AI Act, and similar regulations, will likely define GPAI models with systemic risk based on factors that include:\n","\n","*   **Reach:** The number of users, and the sectors they operate in. Thousands of business users are a strong indicator of broad reach.\n","*   **Criticality:** The importance of the functions that rely on the GPAI. Is it used in high-risk areas like healthcare, finance, or critical infrastructure?\n","*   **Interconnectedness:** The degree to which the GPAI is integrated with other systems and processes within the EU economy.\n","*   **Market Impact:** The potential of a failure to cause significant economic or social disruption within the EU.\n","\n","**5. Consequences of Systemic Risk Classification:**\n","\n","If a GPAI model is deemed to have systemic risk, it will face:\n","\n","*   **Higher Regulatory Scrutiny:** Stricter monitoring, audits, and reporting requirements.\n","*   **Enhanced Transparency Obligations:**  More extensive documentation of the AI's design, data, and algorithms.\n","*   **Stronger Security Measures:**  Mandatory cybersecurity protections and incident response plans.\n","*   **Potentially More Restrictions:** Limits on certain functionalities or use cases.\n","\n","**In summary, the reach of a GPAI model to thousands of EU businesses is a key factor that significantly increases the likelihood of it being classified as having systemic risk.  This classification leads to more stringent regulations and oversight to mitigate the potential for widespread harm from the AI's failures or vulnerabilities.**\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Prompt the model with more options\n","\n","We define two helper functions `generate_text` and `embed_text` so that we quickly and conveniently can call the Gemini text generation and embedding endpoints.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Lwb5I41NCx3_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def generate_text(\n","    prompt: str,\n","    model: str = \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n","    temperature: Optional[float] = None,\n","    max_tokens: Optional[int] = None,\n","    system_instructions: Optional[str] = None\n",") -> str:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Generate text using Google's Gemini model with configurable parameters.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        prompt: The user prompt to send to the model\n","        model: Model name to use (default: gemini-2.0-flash)\n","        temperature: Controls temperature (0.0-2.0, lower is more deterministic)\n","        max_tokens: Maximum number of tokens to generate\n","        system_instructions: Optional system instruction to guide the model\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        Generated text response as string\n","    \"\"\"\n","    try:\n","        # Create config with only non-None parameters\n","        config_params = {}\n","        if temperature:\n","            config_params[\"temperature\"] = temperature\n","        if max_tokens is not None:\n","            config_params[\"max_output_tokens\"] = max_tokens\n","        if system_instructions:\n","            config_params[\"system_instruction\"] = system_instructions\n","\n","        # Create the config object\n","        config = types.GenerateContentConfig(**config_params)\n","\n","        # Generate content\n","        response = client.models.generate_content(\n","            model=model,\n","            contents=[prompt],\n","            config=config\n","        )\n","\n","        return response.text\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        return f\"Error generating text: {str(e)}\"\n","\n","\n","def embed_text(\n","    text: str,\n","    model: str = \"text-embedding-004\"\n",") -> List[float]:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Generate embeddings for a text string using Google's embedding model.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        text: The text to generate embeddings for\n","        model: Embedding model to use (default: text-embedding-004)\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        List of embedding values as floats\n","    \"\"\"\n","    try:\n","        # Generate embeddings\n","        response = client.models.embed_content(\n","            model=model,\n","            contents=[text]\n","        )\n","\n","        # Return the embedding values\n","        return response.embeddings[0].values\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(f\"Error generating embedding: {str(e)}\")\n","        return []"],"metadata":{"id":"Wlj3MlBdCXyg"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Try to prompt the language model with more configurable parameters using the method that will be applied in the workshop."],"metadata":{"id":"PXutNm6pHNT8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["answer = generate_text(query, system_instructions=\"Your task is to answer questions about the EU AI Act as accurately and concisely as possible.\")\n","print(answer)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2fih5LaUCbaC","outputId":"75e39b1e-5d80-44a7-81e5-bbc55d299689"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The EU AI Act doesn't directly classify general-purpose AI (GPAI) models as \"systemic risk\" based solely on the *number* of business users.
