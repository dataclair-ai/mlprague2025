We will implement a similar process targeted at query generation in this notebook.\n","\n","In this notebook, we will get to the main topic of this workshop: *synthetic* ***query*** *generation*. While some methods focus on generating both queries and passages, in most real-world settings you will already have some corpus of documents or passages you want to retrieve data from. Thus, the part you need to collect, write or generate are realistic and diverse user queries.\n","\n","We'll walk through a progressive approach to generating synthetic queries based on the EU AI Act:\n","1. We'll start with basic query generation, demonstrating its limitations\n","2. Then improve with grounded generation based on specific passages\n","3. Increase diversity using persona-based generation\n","4. Enhance quality through few-shot learning with carefully crafted examples\n","5. Finally, implement quality filtering to filter out low-quality examples\n","\n","By the end of this notebook, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to generate high-quality, diverse synthetic queries for fine-tuning embedding models on specialized domains."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Setup\n","\n","> ***Important:*** *As we won't need it in this notebook and usage is limited, make sure you are* ***not*** *using a GPU runtime.
